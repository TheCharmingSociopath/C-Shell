# File structure:
- headers.h contains the declarations, libraries and constants
- main.c contains the main function, and the main loop
- core_functions.c contains the functions required for the working of the main file, like readline, execute, wait handler for background processes, etc.
- rest .c files contain one command each, which is the file name, and contain all the remaining functions related to that file.
- makefile builds the project into an executeable called shell
